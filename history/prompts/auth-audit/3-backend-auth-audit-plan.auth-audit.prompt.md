# Backend Authentication Audit Plan

## Original Request
Create a detailed execution plan for diagnosing and fixing the authentication failure in the backend.

## Plan Summary
Created a comprehensive implementation plan for the backend authentication audit, including:
- Technical context covering the required technologies
- Constitution compliance verification
- Project structure documentation
- Research findings on authentication architecture
- Data models for the audit process
- Quickstart guide for executing the audit

## Key Components
1. Phase 0: Research completed - understanding of authentication architecture
2. Phase 1: Design completed - data models and quickstart guide created
3. Technical Context - properly defined for the audit requirements
4. Constitution Check - verified compliance with project requirements
5. Project Structure - documented for audit purposes

## Outcome
The plan provides a complete roadmap for executing the authentication audit, with all required components created and the agent context updated with the new technologies identified in this feature.
