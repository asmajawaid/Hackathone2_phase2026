# Backend Authentication Audit Tasks

## Original Request
Create a detailed task breakdown for diagnosing and fixing the authentication failure in the backend.

## Task Breakdown Summary
Created comprehensive task breakdown for the backend authentication audit with:
- 7 distinct phases organized by priority and dependency
- 78 individual tasks with proper labeling and sequencing
- Clear user story organization (US1, US2, US3)
- Parallel execution opportunities identified
- Dependencies mapped between phases
- Success criteria validation through specific tasks

## Key Components
1. Phase 1: Setup - Prerequisites and environment verification
2. Phase 2: Foundational - Core audit infrastructure preparation
3. Phase 3: US1 - Authentication system diagnosis tasks
4. Phase 4: US2 - Database schema verification tasks
5. Phase 5: US3 - Configuration consistency check tasks
6. Phase 6: API endpoint testing tasks
7. Phase 7: Log analysis and inspection tasks
8. Phase 8: Verification and audit completion tasks

## Outcome
The task breakdown provides a complete roadmap for executing the authentication audit, with clear progression from setup to completion. Each task follows the required checklist format with proper IDs, labels, and descriptions. The implementation strategy emphasizes MVP first approach with incremental delivery.
