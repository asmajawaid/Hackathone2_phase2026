# Skill: Frontend Integration (Next.js App Router)

## Purpose
This skill provides structured guidance for integrating frontend components and features using Next.js with the App Router, ensuring consistent architecture, performance optimization, and maintainability. It helps developers create well-structured, scalable frontend applications that leverage Next.js capabilities effectively.

## Scope
**Included:**
- Next.js App Router file structure and conventions
- Server and client component patterns
- Data fetching strategies (SSR, SSG, ISR)
- Routing and navigation implementation
- State management integration
- API route integration
- Performance optimization techniques
- SEO and accessibility considerations

**Excluded:**
- Backend API implementation details
- Database design and management
- Authentication implementation specifics
- UI component library design
- Testing frameworks and strategies
- Deployment configurations
- Infrastructure setup

## Responsibilities
- Design and implement Next.js App Router file structure following best practices
- Create reusable and maintainable components using server and client patterns appropriately
- Implement efficient data fetching strategies based on content requirements
- Ensure proper routing and navigation between application sections
- Integrate state management solutions effectively
- Optimize application performance through code splitting and caching
- Apply SEO best practices for improved search visibility
- Ensure accessibility compliance for inclusive user experience

## Inputs
- API specifications and endpoint documentation
- Design mockups and UI/UX requirements
- Performance requirements and constraints
- SEO requirements and guidelines
- Accessibility compliance standards
- Existing backend services and data models
- Brand guidelines and styling requirements

## Outputs
- Next.js App Router page and layout structures
- Server and client component implementations
- Data fetching and caching strategies
- Navigation and routing configurations
- State management integration patterns
- SEO-optimized page metadata and structures
- Accessibility-compliant component implementations
- Performance optimization implementations

## Constraints
- Must follow Next.js App Router conventions and best practices
- Components must be properly categorized as server or client components
- Data fetching must align with rendering strategy requirements
- All pages must meet performance budgets and loading time requirements
- Implementation must be compatible with Next.js version requirements
- SEO requirements must be met for all public-facing pages
- Accessibility standards must be maintained throughout the application

## Failure Cases
- Improper use of server vs client components causing hydration errors
- Inefficient data fetching strategies leading to poor performance
- Incorrect routing implementation causing broken navigation
- Missing SEO optimization resulting in poor search visibility
- Inadequate accessibility compliance excluding users with disabilities
- Poor state management causing unexpected behavior or memory leaks
- Excessive bundle sizes causing slow page loads
- Improper error handling leading to application crashes

## Usage Context
This skill should be applied during:
- Initial setup of Next.js applications with App Router
- Integration of new features into existing Next.js applications
- Migration from Pages Router to App Router
- Performance optimization of existing Next.js applications
- Implementation of complex routing requirements
- SEO improvement initiatives for Next.js applications
- Accessibility compliance efforts for Next.js applications

## Update Notes
- v1.0 (2026-01-07): Initial skill definition created for Frontend Integration with Next.js App Router, focusing on architecture patterns, responsibilities, and usage guidelines for the Todo Application project.
