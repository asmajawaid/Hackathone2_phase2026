# Skill: Agentic Dev Workflow

## Purpose
This skill provides structured guidance for implementing and managing development workflows that leverage AI agents and automation tools. It ensures consistent, efficient, and reliable development processes that maximize the benefits of agentic development while maintaining quality and control.

## Scope
**Included:**
- AI agent integration into development processes
- Automated code generation and review workflows
- Prompt engineering and management strategies
- Development pipeline automation
- Quality assurance and testing integration
- Version control and collaboration patterns
- Knowledge capture and documentation practices
- Tool integration and configuration management

**Excluded:**
- Specific AI model training procedures
- Hardware infrastructure setup
- Individual developer productivity tools
- Business strategy and planning
- Financial analysis of development processes
- Marketing and user acquisition strategies
- Customer support operations

## Responsibilities
- Design and implement efficient AI-assisted development workflows
- Establish quality control processes for AI-generated code
- Create and maintain prompt libraries for consistent outputs
- Integrate AI tools with existing development infrastructure
- Ensure proper documentation and knowledge capture practices
- Implement feedback loops for continuous workflow improvement
- Maintain security and compliance standards in automated processes
- Balance automation with human oversight and decision-making

## Inputs
- Development requirements and specifications
- Existing codebase and architecture documentation
- Team collaboration and communication protocols
- Quality standards and compliance requirements
- Available AI tools and their capabilities
- Project timelines and resource constraints
- Security and privacy requirements

## Outputs
- Streamlined AI-assisted development workflows
- Prompt templates and best practices documentation
- Automated code generation and review processes
- Quality assurance procedures for AI-generated code
- Knowledge capture and documentation systems
- Integration patterns for AI tools with development environments
- Performance metrics and improvement recommendations
- Risk mitigation strategies for AI-assisted development

## Constraints
- Must maintain code quality standards equivalent to or better than manual development
- All AI-generated code must undergo appropriate review processes
- Workflows must comply with security and privacy requirements
- Development processes must remain transparent and auditable
- Human oversight must be maintained for critical decisions
- Intellectual property and licensing requirements must be respected
- Team collaboration and knowledge sharing must be preserved

## Failure Cases
- Over-reliance on AI tools without proper human oversight
- Inadequate quality control leading to bugs in production
- Poor prompt engineering causing inconsistent or incorrect outputs
- Insufficient documentation creating knowledge gaps
- Security vulnerabilities introduced through automated processes
- Loss of institutional knowledge due to over-automation
- Reduced team collaboration due to isolated AI interactions
- Compliance violations due to inadequate oversight of AI outputs

## Usage Context
This skill should be applied during:
- Initial setup of AI-assisted development environments
- Implementation of new AI tools into existing workflows
- Optimization of current development processes with AI
- Training team members on AI-assisted development practices
- Review and improvement of existing agentic workflows
- Establishment of governance and compliance for AI tools
- Scaling development teams with AI assistance

## Update Notes
- v1.0 (2026-01-07): Initial skill definition created for Agentic Dev Workflow, focusing on AI integration principles, responsibilities, and usage guidelines for the Todo Application project.
